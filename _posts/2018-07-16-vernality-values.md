Values Manifesto creates grounds for company's policy decisions. 

In addition to the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org): 

- individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- working software over comprehensive documentation
- customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- responding to change over following a plan

we do value: 

- opportunities and contracts over problems and conflicts
- business goals over technical challenges
- global markets over local opportunities
- add value over maximize profit
- open source over proprietary
