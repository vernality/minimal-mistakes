In addition to the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org): 

- individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- working software over comprehensive documentation
- customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- responding to change over following a plan

we do value: 

- personal trajectories over qualifications
- business goals over technical challenges
- open source over proprietary
- global markets over local opportunities
